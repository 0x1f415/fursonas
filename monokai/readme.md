His name and color scheme is in reference to the [Monokai color scheme originally published by Wimer Hazenberg](https://web.archive.org/web/20161107090516/http://www.monokai.nl/blog/2006/07/) for the Textmate editor (and later popularized by Sublime Text). ([source](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/a/64982))

There are several different versions of the Monokai color palette floating around and all of them are generally fine to use, artists may take artistic liberty with the colors so long as they stay within the normal bounds of the monokai palette.
